# Future-Battlefield-Pack-Orbital-Props

For anyone who want to create new Spacemaps in the Map Editior.
This Mod includes Space Objects as Prop Units:
However these Prop units are not similar like the regular Props from the Game.
They are working as regular units like Stationary or Mobile Units.
So they are selectable, destroyable, movaeble or whatever depending on Stationary or Mobile.
Depending on the Prop a few of them will be able to damage Spaceships, deactive thier Shields or whatever.

Currently it includes these Prop Units as Early Access:
- Comet (Mobile Unit)
- Nebula (Stationary Unit)

Note:
They are still in WIP

Planned:

- Asteroidfield (Stationary Unit)
- Debrisfield (Stationary Unit)
- Wormhole (Stationary Unit)
- Blackhole (Stationary Unit)
- Ion Nebula (Stationary Unit)
- Asteriod (Mobile Unit)

IMPORTANT NOTE:
These Prop units are not buildable by any Faction.
So if you want to check them out ingame spawn them with the Cheat Menu like a regular Unit
The UnitId are categorized as OPOXXXX
